# Solution Week-04 Review Questions

### 1. Compare IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS on the basis of cost, configurability, and control.

   Following table explains the comparison of IaaS, PaaS and SaaS on the basis of cost, configurability and control.

   Cloud Type | Cost | Configurability | Control |
   ---------- | ---- | --------------- | ------- |
   `IaaS`     |      |                 |         |
   `PaaS`     |      |                 |         |
   `SaaS`     |      |                 |         |

### 2. What are the caveats to consider in adopting Software as a Service?

### 3. List the key advantages of virtual machines.

   Following are the few considerable advantages of virtual machines.

   * Virtual machines can achieve effective compute with smart resource utilization.
   * They can be easily created and destroyed and they can be easily made available for use within notime.
   * Virtual machines can be controlled through software API while physical machine needs to assembled.
   * Virtual machines are fully programmable and configuration can be changed easily.
   * Virtual system can be easily moved between physical systems or migrated to another system as and when required. There is practically no downtime for virtual machines.

### 4. Why might you choose physical over virtual machines?

   Because of following reasons I may choose physica machines over virtual machines.

   * If virtual machines are idle then memory reserved for virtual machine is not released hence it cannot be used for other processing. While in case of physical machines, it can be easily allocated for other important tasks.
   * Steal time management mechanism is poor for virtual machines while its better for physical machines.
   * Running different virtual machines in one physical machine for computation is heavy while single OS in terms of physical machine can offer better computation at times.
   * Physical machines offer better disk I/O and optimal network usage.
   * Hardware accesibility is better for physical machine than virtual machine.
   * Operating system cost may be more for virtual systems as you may have to purchase additional license for each virtualization while one operating system is sufficient for one physical machine.

### 5. Which factors might make you choose private over public cloud services?

### 6. Which selection strategy does your current organization use? What are the benefits and caveats of using this strategy?
